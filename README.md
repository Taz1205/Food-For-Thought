## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system to run this project. You will also need to set up an account with Supabase and Spoonacular to obtain the necessary API keys. 

Finally as the server is running as a https server for security, you will need to generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL. Instructions for this are beyond the scope of this project and can be found online.
